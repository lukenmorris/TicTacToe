# Luke's TicTacToe with Minimax Integration

Welcome to Luke's TicTacToe.

Dedicated to Mr.Albinson's Meme Classroom.

This project used Minimax to enhance the intelligence of the AI.

# What is Minimax?
Minimax is a decision rule that is used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game
theory, statistics and philosophy to minimize the potential loss for a worst case scenario. 

# Function
This java program uses integer variables and ArrayLists to define the user and the computers actions.

# Java Files

Position.java - Primary Java file that defines the game board, rules and the minimax algorithm.

PositionTest.java - Test file used to execute and test certain code functions.

Game.java - Executes the game, creates visual game board, and allows for an interactive game experience.

# Known Issues

- Moves are overwritten when clicked on. (Ex. If you click on "x" and you are "o", then the space will turn "o".)
